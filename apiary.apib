# Group Introduction
# Security [/authenticate]
Authenticating Users

Authentication is managed through JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Once you have a token, you should pass it in the Authentication HTTP header on all subsequent requests.
Tokens are single use, and you will get a new token returned to you as an Authentication header in the response.
You should use the new token on the next request, and so on.

## Fetch a security token [POST]
Authenticates the credentials passed, and returns a token for future requests if successful.
